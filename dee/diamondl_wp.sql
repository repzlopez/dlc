As one of the most successful networker in the world with an organization that has sponsored over 3 million distributors, I already have my fair share of recognition and fame. A desire to own a company? Listen to my speeches and training and you will sometime hear me mention that I love my role as a General and have no desire to be the Emperor. So, why start a new MLM company called “Diamond Lifestyle Corporation”?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:media-text -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">After 28 long years, I have found an industry that is my life\'s passion. A business, I believe, is the best available option to channel goods and services. A business option for many who are not satisfied with their present financial situation. A business option for many who have no other business options. After 28 long years, I have also found things that need to be changed to help those who love or need this business and give them a fighting chance. Let us talk about 2 of them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">First. In my opinion, for the last 50 years there is only one MLM company in the world and all the others are pyramid schemes. I would like to ask distributors who believe they are from legitimate companies: If you also operate your business like pyramid schemes, playing the money game, buying up to get bonuses, pins and incentives what is the difference between you and them? DLC intends to close all loopholes to prevent this behavior. We can now say that there are 2 MLM companies in the world: one is called DLC and the other is the biggest MLM company today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Second. With the percentage paid out by all MLM companies and the way their marketing plans are designed, it will be ill-advised for most of you to believe that this business is a vehicle to your dreams. After the owners of MLM companies suck away a huge percentage for themselves, there is not enough money left to give the mid- and lower-level leaders a decent income. That is why all company marketing plans are only designed to look after the 20% high level leaders or the superstars. It is not uncommon to listen to these superstars talk about the 80/20 rule like it is a virtue. We think this is catastrophic. When the 80% of leaders find their income unsatisfactory they may quit and when they do so, it becomes a domino effect on the business of the superstar. This is a fact. If we cannot pay enough to look after the 80% we also cannot look after the 20%. How then can we write a marketing plan that can also look after the 80% of the leaders? THIS IS THE MAIN MISSION OF DLC.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">There is only one solution. I wish there were another. We must write a marketing plan that also includes the 1/3 that is the profit of the owner of a MLM company into the plan. Only when we have this extra 30% can we have enough money to write a marketing plan where we can concentrate a huge portion of the bonuses to distributors who have one to three break-off legs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Yes, I understand what I am doing is abnormal. It is normal and right for all owners of MLM companies to make a profit from their investment for the risk they are taking.

Payout Value (POV) will depend on the factory price DLC buys from the manufacturer. Due to DLC’s unchanging commitment to provide the best quality products, some catalogued products will have higher factory price.

It is not uncommon to listen to these superstars talk about the 80/20 rule like it is a virtue. We think this is catastrophic. When the 80% of leaders find their income unsatisfactory they may quit and when they do so, it becomes a domino effect on the business of the superstar. This is a fact.

Normally, this distributor does not have a solid organization.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Experience have taught us that distributors who overload products are normally encouraged to do so by their upline(s) because the upline(s) want to qualify for some benefit(s). In all cases, even if the upline(s) did not encourage this activity, they know about it. It is the responsibility of all distributors who have downlines to do MLM properly, to work within the laws of local government and to guide their downlines. We do not want people to play games in this Company. Please get the message or the Upline(s) will be held accountable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">The \"Product Buy Back Rules\" (Product Return) is designed for the following reasons:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Each sponsor is obliged to ensure sponsored downline distributor purchases and orders products prudently. We do not want inventory loading or game playing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">All distributors shall order products in a quantity based on his/her actual need. As recommended, distributors are encouraged to purchase additional products only after 70% of the initial inventory has been sold or otherwise disposed. This is our 30/70% rule.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">In the event that the downline distributor insists to purchase products in quantities exceeding normal volumes, the sponsor shall try his/her best efforts to persuade the distributor to cease the activities. Failing this, the sponsor must inform DLC, and all upline managers and distributors in this line, in writing within thirty (30) days of such activities. This will release him/her of all responsibilities. All uplines in turn must take similar action to release them of responsibility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Failing to do the above, every sponsor must offer to buy back from any of his/her distributor who wishes to discontinue their business any unused and currently marketable products. Plea of ignorance is no defense and will not be entertained.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">The responsibility to buy-back the products passes up the line of sponsorship from distributor to distributor up to all managers in this line. If the sponsor fails or refuses to buy-back the products, this responsibility goes up to his sponsor until someone in the line assumes responsibility. In the event no one assumes this responsibility, DLC will buy them back according to the Buy-Back Policy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"className\":\"jt\"} -->\n<p class=\"jt\">Uplines who are members of the Profit Sharing Bonus or President Award will lose their Profit Sharing bonus for one qualified year and all, or a portion, of their PAP at the discretion of the Executive Committee.

Uplines who are not yet members of the Profit Sharing Bonus or President’s Award cannot qualify for these awards in the future.
